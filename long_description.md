We are translating MS-COCO Captions to {{language}}. This will solve two problems:

1. We get image captions in {{language}}, useful to train a {{language}}
   image-captioning AI. This is an artificial intelligence that is
   capable of describing an image you give it. We want to build a
   dataset that will enable students and researchers to build such AI
   models for {{language}}, whenever they want.

2. We get sentences translated to {{language}}. This will provide us with what AI
   researchers called 'aligned sentences'. This is very important for
   certain methods of English-{{language}} translation, and is often useful
   for building an AI that can translate from English to {{language}}.
